Voronoi

Just a voronoi generator I made in my free time using pure javascript.
There are a few things you can do to control it:

mouse click generates new points
space toggles the movement of the points
- increases the resolution resulting in worse performance, especially if moving
+ decreases the resolution resulting in better performance, especially if moving
c toggles the change of the points' colors (flash warning)
p toggles the drawing of the points
o toggles the change of color of the points
